Dear all,

We will have our movie night on **March 13th starting at 18:00**. We will use the beamer of our coffee room which is EWI 3rd floor, room **HB03.030**.

There is more reason to come: Guido will give a historic introduction to the movie and we will order pizza and eat the left-overs of the Krylov Day ;) ...
