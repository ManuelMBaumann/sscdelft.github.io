title: Project baNaNa
---

The project 'baNaNa' is a self-organised seminar from the PhD students of the numerical analysis department at TU Delft. Our aim is to present practical tools and applications from the every-day use of a mathematician to each other. The seminar will be held on a monthly basis and in an informal manner.
