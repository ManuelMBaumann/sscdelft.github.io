### Secretary and Treasurer: Thea Vuik 
My name is Thea Vuik and I am the first secretary and treasure of the first SIAM Student Chapter in The Netherlands, at Delft University of Technology. In addition to this honourable task, I am a PhD student, working with Dr. Jennifer Ryan. My research focuses on the detection of shocks and discontinuities in discontinuous Galerkin schemes, using a multiwavelet decomposition. If you have any questions about my research or the SIAM Student Chapter, don't hesitate to ask me! You can reach me by sending an email to [M.J.Vuik@tudelft.nl](mailto:M.J.Vuik@tudelft.nl).
