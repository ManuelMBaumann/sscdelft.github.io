President: [Manuel Baumann]
---------------------------

Hi! My name is Manuel and I am a PhD student of Martin van Gijzen. My research is in the field of numerical linear algebra, but I am also interested in model order reduction and optimal control.
Besides math, I like tennis and skying as well as traveling. My last vacation was in China (see right). You can best contact me via [email](mailto:M.M.Baumann@tudelft.nl) or twitter [@ManuelMBaumann](https://twitter.com/ManuelMBaumann).

Secretary and Treasurer: Thea Vuik 
---------------------------

My name is Thea Vuik and I am the first secretary and treasure of the first SIAM Student Chapter in The Netherlands, at Delft University of Technology. In addition to this honourable task, I am a PhD student, working with Dr. Jennifer Ryan. My research focuses on the detection of shocks and discontinuities in discontinuous Galerkin schemes, using a multiwavelet decomposition. If you have any questions about my research or the SIAM Student Chapter, don't hesitate to ask me! You can reach me by sending an [email](mailto:M.J.Vuik@tudelft.nl).
