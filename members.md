---------------------------

Hi! My name is Manuel and I am a PhD student of Martin van Gijzen. My research is in the field of numerical linear algebra, but I am also interested in model order reduction and optimal control.
I like beer and girls. If you are one of them, please [email me](mailto:M.M.Baumann@tudelft.nl).

### Vice President: [Reinaldo Astudillo]

### Secretary and Treasurer: Thea Vuik 
My name is Thea Vuik and I am the first secretary and treasure of the first SIAM Student Chapter in The Netherlands, at Delft University of Technology. In addition to this honourable task, I am a PhD student, working with Dr. Jennifer Ryan. My research focuses on the detection of shocks and discontinuities in discontinuous Galerkin schemes, using a multiwavelet decomposition. If you have any questions about my research or the SIAM Student Chapter, don't hesitate to ask me! You can reach me by sending an email to [M.J.Vuik@tudelft.nl](mailto:M.J.Vuik@tudelft.nl).
