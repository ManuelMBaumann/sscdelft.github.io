We started our [SIAM student chapter] in 2014 based on a group of PhD candidates of the [Numerical Analysis department] at TU Delft. Our goal is to organize lectures on both, research and practice oriented topics. Our group mostly focuses on:

+ Numerical Analysis,
+ Scientific Computing,
+ Software tools.

Our Faculty Advisors are [Kees Vuik] and [Martin van Gijzen].
