The SIAM Student Chapter Delft has been founded in 2014 by PhD students of the
[Numerical Analysis section at TU Delft][NA-EWI-TUD].  This Student Chapter is
the first [division of SIAM][SIAM Student Chapters] in The Netherlands, and is
meant to bring together MSc and PhD students, postdocs and professors from all
mathematically oriented departments.  The Chapter organizes seminars, lectures
(both on research and on practical tools), company visits and social
activities.

Currently involved departments (to be extended):

* Applied Mathematics (sections Statistics, Mathematical Physics, Numerical
  Analysis)
* Aerospace Engineering (section Aerodynamics)
* Electrical Engineering (section Circuits and Systems)
* Marine and Transport Technology (section Offshore & Dredging Engineering)

Faculty advisors are [Kees Vuik] and [Martin van Gijzen].
